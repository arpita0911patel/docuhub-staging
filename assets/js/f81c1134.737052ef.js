This software allows users to run NextGen in an efficient, relatively painless, and reproducible fashion, increasing community access to the NextGen framework. ngen-datastream is already community accessible (https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main) and making an impact on research.  A major component of this software is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based research datastream (https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main/research_datastream). The research datastream is a CONUS-wide recurring NextGen simulation configured by the community. The terraform to build the AWS infrastructure exists in the ngen-datastream repository and current development focuses on CI/CD and enabling community contribution to the research datastream via edits to the NextGen configuration. Ultimately, these tools help distribute access throughout the community to cutting edge hydrologic research, maximizing the pace of progress of research to operations in hydrology.\\n\\n### Contribution to CIROH: \\n\\n- **Automation**: It automates the process of collecting, formatting, and validating input data for NextGen, streamlining model preparation.\\n- **Flexibility**: It allows users to provide their own input files to run NextGen.\\n- **Scalable Infrastructure**: It utilizes AWS state machine to provide access to high-performance computing (HPC) resources.\\n\\n\\n### Infrastructure Utilized: \\n\\n- **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**\\n- **Simple Storage Service (S3)** \\n- **AWS Lamda and Step Functions**\\n\\n\\n## 2. TEEHR\\n\\n- **PI** : Katie van Wekhoven\\n- **Co-PI** : Matt Denno (Development Lead)\\n- **Developer** : Sam Lamont\\n\\n### Project Overview:\\n\\nThe goal of this project is to investigate, design, and build a prototype hydrologic model/forecast evaluation system (TEEHR) that will significantly improve our ability to evaluate continental-scale datasets and will provide a robust and consistent evaluation tool for CIROH and OWP research. Design priorities include easy integration into common research workflows, rapid execution of large-scale evaluations, simplified exploration of performance trends and drivers, inclusion of common and emergent evaluation methods, efficient data structures, open-source and community development, and easy extensibility.\\n\\n\\n<span className=\\"hero-image\\" style={{ textAlign: \'center\' }}>\\n        <img src=\\"/img/teehr-image.png\\" alt=\\"teehr image\\" style={{ width: \'40%\' }} />\\n</span>\\n\\n### Contribution to CIROH: \\n\\n- **TEEHR-HUB**: It is a JupyterHub environment, running the TEEHR image, with AWS services (EFS and S3) to provide a scalable platform for hydrologic research.\\n- **Data Processing**: TEEHR-HUB has successfully processed the AORC (v3.0 retrospective) gridded precipitation data to the MERIT basins, as well as the CONUS 40-year retrospective (v3.0 and USGS).\\n- **Testbed Integration**: TEEHR-HUB\u2019s compatibility with various testbeds allows researchers to experiment with different hydrologic models and datasets.\\n- **Evaluation** - TEEHR is being used (or is planned for use) by several CIROH research teams to evaluate large scale model results.\\n\\n### Infrastructure Utilized: \\n\\n- **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** (including supporting AWS services) - Scalable computing resources to host JupyterHub Dask and Spark\\n- **Elastic File System (EFS)** - Shared data drive for cached data and shared documents (notebooks, etc.)\\n- **Simple Storage Service (S3)** - Bucket storage for large public and private datasets"},{"id":"July Monthly IT Update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/July Monthly IT Update","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-31-IT-Update.md","title":"CIROH Research CyberInfrastructure Update","description":"July Monthly IT Update","date":"2024-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ciroh","permalink":"/blog/tags/ciroh"},{"inline":true,"label":"2i2c","permalink":"/blog/tags/2-i-2-c"},{"inline":true,"label":"google","permalink":"/blog/tags/google"},{"inline":true,"label":"gpu","permalink":"/blog/tags/gpu"},{"inline":true,"label":"reu","permalink":"/blog/tags/reu"},{"inline":true,"label":"bigquery","permalink":"/blog/tags/bigquery"},{"inline":true,"label":"api","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"inline":true,"label":"aws","permalink":"/blog/tags/aws"},{"inline":true,"label":"nsf","permalink":"/blog/tags/nsf"}],"readingTime":1.495,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Arpita Patel","title":"DevOps Manager and Enterprise Architect","url":"https://github.com/arpita0911patel","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4","key":"arpita","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"CIROH Research CyberInfrastructure Update","description":"July Monthly IT Update","slug":"July Monthly IT Update","authors":"arpita","tags":["ciroh","2i2c","google","gpu","reu","bigquery","api","aws","nsf"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"image":"/img/summer-institute.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"CIROH Cloud User Success Story","permalink":"/blog/August Monthly Blog Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"CIROH Developers Conference 2024","permalink":"/blog/CIROH Developers Conference 2024"}},"content":"We\'re excited to share some recent developments and updates from CIROH\'s Research CyberInfrastructure team:\\n\\n### Cloud Infrastructure\\n\\n- CIROH\'s Google Cloud Account is now fully operational and managed by our team.

NextGen is a cutting-edge hydrologic modeling framework that aims to advance the science and practice of hydrology and water resources management. In this month\'s blog, we will highlight some of the recent achievements and developments of the Community NextGen team.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\nFirst, we are excited to announce that NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) is now available with Singularity support. This means that you can run NGIAB on any HPC system that does not support Docker, using Singularity containers. Singularity is a popular tool for creating and running portable and reproducible computational environments. To learn how to use NGIAB with Singularity, please visit our GitHub repository: [Ngen-Singularity](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/Ngen-Singularity).\\n\\nSecond, we have made several improvements and enhancements to NGIAB, such as updating the sample input data, upgrading the Boost library, adding auto mode run, and supporting geopackage format. You can find more details about these updates on our GitHub repository: [NGIAB-CloudInfra](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra).\\n\\nThird, we would like to share with you is the development of NextGen Datastream, a tool that automates the process of collecting and formatting input data for NextGen, orchestrating the NextGen run through NextGen In a Box (NGIAB), and handling outputs. The NextGen Datastream is a shell script that orchestrates each step in the process, using a configuration file that specifies the data sources, parameters, and options for the NextGen run. The NextGen Datastream can also generate its own internal configs and modify the configuration file as needed. You can find more details and instructions on how to use the NextGen Datastream on our GitHub repository: [ngen-datastream](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/blob/main/README.md).\\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this blog and found it informative and useful. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please feel free to contact us at ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu. Thank you for your interest and support in the Community NextGen project. Stay tuned for more exciting news and developments in the next month. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n[Visit NGIAB News](https://docs.ciroh.org/news)"},{"id":"NextGen Updates Dec 2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/NextGen Updates Dec 2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-30-NextGen-Update-Monthly.md","title":"NextGen Monthly News Update - December 2023","description":"News and release notes for NextGen","date":"2023-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"}],"readingTime":0.2,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Arpita Patel","title":"DevOps Manager and Enterprise Architect","url":"https://github.com/arpita0911patel","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4","key":"arpita","page":null},{"name":"Zach Wills","title":"at Lynker","url":"https://github.com/orgs/CIROH-UA/people/ZacharyWills","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60660437?v=4","key":"zach","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"NextGen Monthly News Update - December 2023","description":"News and release notes for NextGen","slug":"NextGen Updates Dec 2023","authors":["arpita","zach"],"tags":["news"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"NextGen Monthly News Update - January 2024","permalink":"/blog/NextGen Updates Jan 2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"NextGen In A Box v1.1.0 Release","permalink":"/blog/NextGen In A Box Release Notes"}},"content":"Happy New Year!!!
