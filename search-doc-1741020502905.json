Note: you only have to do this once, not every time you open a new terminal or want to use mamba or conda.If the command ran successfully, you should see something like this now at the command line: (base) [jsmith@ciroh-testbed ~]$ The (base) text indicates that you are in the base environment. To see the list of packages in said enviornment (or any environment you happen to be in), run mamba list or conda list.To see a list of available environments, run mamba env list or, if using conda, 'conda info --envs'. Most relevant environments will be located in /data/condaShared/envs.Note: This is one of the VERY few commands that differ between mamba and conda.

This allows for better cost allocation, resource identification, and easier filtering when managing resources across multiple accounts. Follow How to tag resources on AWS. Cost allocation: Allowed limit for new subaccount is $500/project per month. Monitor the usage throughout the month and if it reaches above $500/project, notify admin of the subaccount to take necessary actions. For projects expecting more than $500 per month usage, please email ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu in advance to get the approval from higher management. Effective Sept 2024, we transitioned to a new budgeting model (for existing users) that provides your CIROH AWS subaccount with a $10,000 budget for every 6-month period and monthly max limit of $3000. This change will give you more flexibility to plan and execute your research workloads without the constraints of a monthly cap. Resource quotas: Set resource quotas for subaccounts to limit their spending and resource usage. This helps prevent accidental overspending and ensures efficient resource allocation. Monitor resource usage: Encourage subaccount admins to monitor their resource usage regularly to identify potential cost optimization opportunities. Data Locality: Always consider the location of your data when selecting a region for deploying resources. Deploying resources in the same region as your data minimizes data transfer costs and latency, leading to improved performance and cost-efficiency. Region Selection: Carefully evaluate the available AWS regions and select the one that best aligns with your data residency requirements, compliance needs, and desired performance characteristics.  EBS:  EBS Volume Management: Avoiding Unnecessary Costs: Terminate EBS Volumes with Terminated Instances: When terminating an EC2 instance, ensure that you also delete any associated EBS volumes that are no longer needed. EBS volumes incur charges even if they are not attached to a running instance. Regularly Review EBS Volume Usage: Periodically review your EBS volumes using the EC2 Management Console or AWS CLI.

Utilizing Slurm, a user initiates a request for resources and submits a job to a designated queue. Subsequently, the system undertakes the task of extracting jobs from the queues, assigning the requisite compute nodes, and executing the submitted tasks. Although users typically access the Slurm job scheduler by SSH-ing to a Pantarhei login node, it is imperative to emphasize that the recommended practice entails utilizing Slurm to submit work as a job, as opposed to executing computationally intensive tasks directly on a login node. Given that all users share the login nodes, running anything beyond minimal test jobs can adversely affect the collective ability of users to effectively utilize Pantarhei resources. Pantarhei's framework is tailored to accommodate the moderate-scale computational and data requirements of the majority of CIROH users. Users with allocations possess the capability to submit tasks to a diverse array of queues, each featuring distinct job size and walltime constraints. Dedicated sets of queues are allocated for CPU, GPU, and FPGA nodes, with typically shorter walltime and smaller job size limits translating to expedited turnaround times. Several additional considerations regarding Pantarhei queues merit attention: Pantarhei facilitates shared jobs, whereby multiple tasks can be executed on a single node. This approach enhances job throughput, maximizes overall system utilization, and fosters increased user accessibility to Pantarhei resources.Pantarhei accommodates long-running jobs, with run times extendable up to seven days for tasks utilizing up to 6 full nodes.The maximum permissible job size on Pantarhei is 240 cores.
